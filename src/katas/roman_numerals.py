# TODO: Implement the RomanNumerals class and its generate method below.
#
# What should you do?
# Create a class called RomanNumerals with a method named generate(self, number: int).
# The generate method should:
#   - Convert the given integer (between 1 and 3999) into its Roman numeral representation as a string.
#   - Return False if the number is less than 1 or greater than or equal to 4000.
#
# Example usage:
#   rn = RomanNumerals()
#   result = rn.generate(1999)  # result should be "MCMXCIX"
#   result = rn.generate(4)     # result should be "IV"
#   result = rn.generate(0)     # result should be False
#
# Try to write code that follows these rules!
