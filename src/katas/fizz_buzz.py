# TODO: Implement the FizzBuzz class and its convert method below.
#
# What should you do?
# Create a class called FizzBuzz with a method named convert(self, number: int).
# The convert method should:
#   - Return "Fizz" if the number is divisible by 3 (but not 5)
#   - Return "Buzz" if the number is divisible by 5 (but not 3)
#   - Return "FizzBuzz" if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5
#   - Return the original number if it is not divisible by 3 or 5
#
# Example usage:
#   fizz_buzz = FizzBuzz()
#   result = fizz_buzz.convert(15)  # result should be "FizzBuzz"
#
# Try to write code that follows these rules!
