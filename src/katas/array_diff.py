# TODO: Implement the ArrayDiff class and its differentiate method below.
#
# What should you do?
# Create a class called ArrayDiff with a method named differentiate(self, arrayOne: list, arrayTwo: list) -> list.
# The differentiate method should:
#   - Take two lists of items (arrayOne and arrayTwo)
#   - Return a new list with all items from arrayOne that are NOT present in arrayTwo
#
# Example usage:
#   ad = ArrayDiff()
#   result = ad.differentiate([1, 2, 2, 3], [2])  # result should be [1, 3]
#   result = ad.differentiate([1, 2, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])  # result should be []
#
# Try to write code that follows these rules!
