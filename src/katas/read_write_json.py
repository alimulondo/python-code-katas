# TODO: Implement functions to write to and read from a JSON file below.
#
# What should you do?
# Write two functions:
#   1. write_to_json_file(data: dict, file_name: str):
#        - This function should save the dictionary 'data' to a file with the name 'file_name' in JSON format.
#   2. read_from_json_file(file_name: str):
#        - This function should read a JSON file with the name 'file_name' and return its contents as a dictionary.
#
# Example usage:
#   write_to_json_file({'a': 1, 'b': 2}, 'output.json')
#   data = read_from_json_file('output.json')  # data should be {'a': 1, 'b': 2}
#
# Try to write code that follows these rules!
