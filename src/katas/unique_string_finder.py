# TODO: Implement the UniqueStringFinder class and its find_unique method below.
#
# What should you do?
# Create a class called UniqueStringFinder with a method named find_unique(self, list_of_strings: list).
# The find_unique method should:
#   - Take a list of strings as input
#   - Return the string that is unique (i.e., appears only once when compared case-insensitively and by character set)
#   - If all strings are the same (case-insensitive, by character set), return any one of them
#
# Example usage:
#   finder = UniqueStringFinder()
#   result = finder.find_unique(["abc", "bca", "CAB", "xyz"])  # result should be "xyz"
#   result = finder.find_unique(["abc", "bca", "cab"])         # result could be any of them
#
# Try to write code that follows these rules!
