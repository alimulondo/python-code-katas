# TODO: Implement the PrimeFactors class and its generate method below.
#
# What should you do?
# Create a class called PrimeFactors with a method named generate(self, number: int).
# The generate method should:
#   - Return a list of the prime factors of the given number.
#     For example:
#         - generate(1) should return []
#         - generate(2) should return [2]
#         - generate(6) should return [2, 3]
#         - generate(8) should return [2, 2, 2]
#         - generate(9) should return [3, 3]
#
# Example usage:
#   pf = PrimeFactors()
#   result = pf.generate(12)  # result should be [2, 2, 3]
#
# Try to write code that follows these rules!
